    <p>Plug-in hybrids offer drivers a chance to experience driving limited range full electric mode, and still get to keep a Hybrid Engine</p>
    <p>We can see a demand for this type of vehicle but the units sold is not as much as the HEV, which sold 800,000 units in 2021. The PHEV only sold 179,000 units in 2021</p>
